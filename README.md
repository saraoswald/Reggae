# Reggae Remixed

![Preview of Reggae Remixed](ReggaeRemixedPreview.png)

This is a version of [Fontwork's Reggae](https://github.com/fontworks-fonts/Reggae) typeface that adapts it for use in English-language comics. 

**This font includes 119 additional characters** (like Ō and Å) that were composed with the original accent glyphs from Reggae One. This font also uses OpenType contextual alternates to replace a crossbar I glyph for personal I's per comic lettering conventions. 

All modifications are made in accordance to the [SIL Open Font License](https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL) on Reggae.
